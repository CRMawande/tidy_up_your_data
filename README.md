# Task 3: Tidy Up Your Data
## Course: DLBDSDQDW01 – Data Quality and Data Wrangling
## Dataset: Goodreads Books (Kaggle) 

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the process of tidying and cleaning a noisy, untidy dataset.
I chose the Goodreads Books dataset from Kaggle (Soumik, 2019), which contains metadata about thousands of books including titles, authors, ratings, publication details, and ISBN numbers.
The dataset was selected because it exhibits common data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent data types, duplicates, and outliers.
